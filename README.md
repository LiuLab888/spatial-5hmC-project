# spatial-5hmC-project
####################### General description #######################

Our group has previously built up the data analysis pipeline of spatial 5mC sequencing on GitHub.

Owing to the comparable library structure in spatial 5hmC sequencing compared with 5mC, we can use almost the same data analysis procedures and contents, and just replace the input sequencing data of 5mC with that of 5hmC. 

If you would like to obtain more details, please browse https://github.com/LiuLab888/spatial-5mC-project.
